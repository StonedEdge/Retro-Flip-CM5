# Retro-Flip-CM5
Stay tuned... dual screen flip handheld? Or something like that. Upgrades over the CM5 will include:

- Analog triggers via RP2350B and hall sensors
- BQ25792 with dual power path support for VBUS input
- TPS65988D (for 2 USB-C ports) - one port supports USB 3.0, OTG and DP. Other port supports USB 2.0 and PD
- USB hubba hubba. 
- Hall sensor for lid switch
- Two USB-C ports for top and bottom (two VBUS channels, two USB 2.0) - may need an internal hub.
- Better OEM buttons, like from the 3DS. Not sure what I'll do about the triggers, will have to work it out... soonTM. 
- Better analog sticks (not switch sticks) - 3DS sliders?
- Slightly thinner profile than Retro Lite (was a bit thick in the previous version). Custom heatpipe plus finstack. 
- Button for entering maskrom mode 
- Two screens? Hell yeah!
- Flips. Yeah, open the clam. 3DS hinges.
